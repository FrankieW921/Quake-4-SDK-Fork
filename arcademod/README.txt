How to play:

Start a new game!

Killing enemies increases your combo counter by 1, up to a max of 10. 

Getting to certain combos gives you buffs.
1: +5 health
3: Haste
5: Invisibility
7: +15 armor
10: Quad Damage

Getting hit by an enemy gives you a debuff with a 1/5 chance of each happening:
1. Combo gets reset to 0
2. -5 health in addition to the damage you take from the attack
3. -5 armor in addition to the damage you take from the attack
4. Disables buffs (resets on kill, so you can still recover your
		    quad damage if you get this one at 10)
5. Disables the Hud

All 10 main weapons (no napalm gun) have the ammo properties and names of 
weapons from Half-Life 1

Could not figure out how to get the custom rigged models for the HL1 weapons to replace
the world models for Quake 4. However if they did, they would be seen when using the 
console command "spawn weapon_[weaponname]".
